This is a tenting case for the Iris. This case is designed for 3/32 silicon feet on the underside of the PCB.

Uses standard 3mm hardware. You'll need bolts (I recommend thumbscrews) about 16mm long.

To improve traction, wrap a #30 rubber band around each leg lengthwise.

EDIT 15-Mar-2019 - Case updated to allow for more room for the pro micro.
