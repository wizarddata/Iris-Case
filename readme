As of 3/12/2019 this case has not been tested. If you print one of these for a build let me know and I'1l remove this warning.

This is a tenting case for the Iris. This case is designed for 3/32 silicon feet on the underside of the PCB. 

You'll need to get the pro micro as close as you can to the PCB, the cheapest way to do this is remove the black plastic from the pin headers. 
Be sure to trim switch legs under the micro and use a piece of tape for electrical insulation.

Uses standard 3mm hardware. You'll need four (4) bolts (I recommend thumbscrews) 16mm - 20mm long, four (4) nuts, and eight (8) 5mm diameter magnets for each half. 

The magnets will need to be glued in place. The hat is a press fit into the switchplate and there are provisions to add some adhesive after assembly if necessary.

To improve traction, wrap a #30 rubber band around each leg lengthwise. Compatible with Ergodox EZ legs as well.

The units of these models are in inches.
