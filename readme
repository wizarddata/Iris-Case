As of 3/12/2019 this case has not been tested. If you print one of these for a build let me know and I'1l remove this warning.

This is a tenting case for the Iris. This case is designed for 3/32 silicon feet on the underside of the PCB. 

Uses standard 3mm hardware. You'll need bolts (I recommend thumbscrews) 16mm - 20mm long and eight (8) 5mm diameter magnets. 

The magnets will need to be glued in place. The hat is a press fit into the switchplate and there are provisions to add some adhesive after assembly if necessary.

To improve traction, wrap a #30 rubber band around each leg lengthwise. Compatible with Ergodox EZ legs as well.
